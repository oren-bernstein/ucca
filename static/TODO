Adaptations to Mozilla:
=======================


Tomer:
======

Done:


To do:
   * settings are not saved and loaded well: the problem is only with the lower buttons.
   * one cannot copy-paste from the text area when pressing "shift+x" (display xml) in firefox. do you know what the problem is?
   * change error messages when creating the passage.

Things Omri did:


Omri:
=====

To do:

      * disallow assigning review tasks only to guests.
      * change status in "/reviewTasks" to text (instead of 0/1).
            
   Bugs:
      * problem with discontiguous units in passage 338, annotation from 19/9, 14:17.
      * toggleFinished() of a discontiguous unit inside a discontiguous unit gives me trouble.
      * check omria passage "for the past two years". there is a problem with using the "down" button.
      * problem in unit 348 in passage 355 of admin.
      * look at passage 347 for example. All I did was creating a+c as discontiguous unit, then b as another one. When I click on 'c', both a+c and b are selected. when a or b are clicked, the right units get selected. see if it's somehow a bug that lead to others..
      
   App:
      * the ability to an annotator to mark a part of the passage as unanalyzable (like this automatically extracted parts).
      * have a menu to look at remarks about the passages in one place.
      * better error messages for the admin.
      * when looking at someone else's passage, there should be an indication of it.
      * keyboard shortcut for collapse without finishing.
      * make sure that when there is a problem with "finish", the pointerUnit jumps to the violating unit.
      * alt+e should jump to a unit also if it's open.
      * del all sub-tree option.

   Minor:
      * shortcut for selecting all the text between two punctuation marks.
      * Add 'home' and 'end' functions to browse the text.
      * 'Function' and 'TBD' should not have the same color (grey).       
      * In addition to 'finish', there should also be an option for 'return later' (though doesn't collapse do just that?).
      * In the '/passages' mode, sometimes it shows half words. 
      * F2 should be available not only in '/text'.
      * slight bug with page down on the help menu.
      * Clearer display of the ancestors of the unit in focus.
      * Change the cursor to sandwatch until the 'save' operation retunrs.

   Extras:
      * Ari's idea with "tab".
      * suggestions for user: how do we display them?
          -- for instance: in an elaborator which is also a scene, we should give a warning if there is no omitted argument.
      * have an option to have set as C in X, where C is a category and X is a unit.   
      * allow scrolling when the page isn't full yet.
      * It would have been nice if I could change the size of the text window.      
      * minor bug: if you scroll down with the mouse in the passage box, when it reaches the bottom, it starts scrolling down the main window.
      * have a separate scrollbar for the units.

        
Things Tomer did for you to review and delete from this list: 


Future:
=======

   * we also need to make sure that external people can upload their texts, annotate them, and get them back.
   * A+focus and E+focus categories?
   * Implicit linkers? allow more than two arguments in a linkage?

   Application:
      * is there a good option of playing with the sub-units when in their parents unit (following Ari's comment)?   
      * have an option to see where is the original instance of a remote unit. is this enough?
      * have a short text explaining what the ruler is for.        
      * have an option to delete all sub-units of a given unit, include the unit itself.      
      * add a keyboard option for seeing linkage arguments.  
      * make passage groups.      


Possibilities:
==============

        * Write something to compare between alternative annotations.
        * add a search option to the unit history (only if we make it unbounded).
        * finished units should appear different in the passage window.
          Perhaps it would suffice to have an option of defining a clause (or some other unit?) as missing an argument...
        * add an option to add to the linkage its linkage-marker?? in that case, it will automatically be the first element 
          in the second linked unit. in the same vain, add an option to add to the role marker, the entity it marks.
        * add a redo and undo button.
        ? how do we allow morphology? allow splitting units (maybe a window opens and you decide where to split)
        * have an option to automatically add relative clause and the omitted argument in the interface.
        ? where there is only one option, set the linkage automatically.
        ? adding white space at the bottom, so not always to work at the bottom of the screen.
        * find gifs for animations to make the user happy. 
        * sounds:
                * add chain clinging sound and chain breaking sound when assigning a link, or removing a link.
                * add sounds for grouping a unit, ungrouping a unit and setting a category (probably a click is enough)
                * should be controled by an option in the settings dialog.
        * having an inheritence hierarchy of annotation schemes.
        * have a read-only mode with worked out examples and explanations.
