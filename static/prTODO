Webpages:
========

/users:
-- in "tasks": add percentage per project

/projects:
-- a table of all the user groups with the columns: id, name, version
name (there will be a file with a corresponding name on the server),
manage users (add or remove), manage passages (add or remove passage groups).
-- there will be an option to add a project (no users or passage
groups at first) and to delete a group.

/tasks:

/annotate:
-- add a separate table for each of the projects.

/text:

/passages:
-- disfunctional.

modifications:
-- users are not assigned to projects. an admin can assign any user to
any passage in any project.
-- when defining a task, you must specify the project, and a list of
(UID, PID). the server must verify that
the PID is of a passage-group which is allowed for the specified
project. otherwise, returns error.



Done:
=====

/projects:
-- added an option from the main menu
-- a new project requires specifying its name, version and config file
(html select). the server must check: (a) that the config files exists
on server, (b) if the same version was previously used, it must be
with the same config file and vice versa.
-- note: we need a directory in py/huca/ called configs/

/text:
-- before loading a passage, load the config file.
-- in the xml, save the project's name and the config name as well (I
know it's redundant).
-- when you send to save, submit, unfit, you should send the project's
name as well.


/tasks:
-- requires only testing.

/passages:
-- in "annotations", separate them according to projects. (NOTE: Sure we need separate tables? or a column for project name is enough)

/sam:
-- there will be a scroll menu for choosing which project you would
like to operate sam in.
