<--FUNCTION

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Function (F)</h3>
<p>
Does not correspond/introduce a relation or participant. Some structural pattern necessitates it.
The structural pattern and the F are inseparable:
(i) Fs cannot be substituted by another word to get a generally similar meaning and
(ii) the F does not receive a similar meaning in any other construction.
Also, if no other category applies to a unit, it's an F.
</p>
<p>
For example:
<ul>
<li>
"I<sub>A</sub> want<sub>D</sub> [to<sub>F</sub> run<sub>C</sub>]<sub>P</sub> [a marathon]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
"I<sub>A</sub> [am<sub>F</sub> going<sub>C</sub>]<sub>P</sub> [to the supermarket]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
"It<sub>F</sub> [is likely]<sub>S</sub> [that he wouldn't make it]<sub>A</sub>"
</li>
</ul>

</div>

<--PARTICIPANT

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Participant (A)</h3>
<p>
Participant in the scene (including a location). Often a noun phrase. Can also be a clause construed as a partcipant.
All the elaborators and relators of the participant should be contained in the A unit.
</p>
<p>
A scene is what we conceive at a given time - a conception of a state, action or movement. 
It has a specified ground, and usually a specified time and location.
</p><p>
<ul><li>
"John<sub>A</sub> boiled [an egg]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
“Programming<sub>A</sub> is widely taught nowadays”
</li><li>
"John<sub>A</sub> told me<sub>A</sub> that<sub>F</sub> [he won't make it]<sub>A</sub>"
</li>
<li>
"John<sub>A</sub> cut [the cake]<sub>A</sub> [with a knife]<sub>A</sub>"
<li>
"John<sub>A</sub> took one<sub>A</sub> [for the team]<sub>A</sub>"
</li></ul>
</p>
</div>

<--STATE

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>State (S)</h3>
<p>
The main relation in a static scene. Static scenes are scenes that remain constant for the duration of the scene. There is exactly one State in a scene (it may be implicit). States include their auxiliary verbs and copulas (e.g., ``is'' in example #1), if present.
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
"John [is tall]<sub>S</sub>"
</li><li>
"[The apple tree]<sub>A</sub>  [is in]<sub>S</sub> [the garden]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
"It<sub>F</sub> [is likely]<sub>S</sub> [that he wouldn't make it]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
"[The new model]<sub>A</sub> [is available]<sub>S</sub> [from many PC vendors]<sub>A</sub>"
</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<--PROCESS

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Process (P)</h3>
<p>
The main relation in a dynamic scene. Dynamic scenes are scenes that evolves in time. Usually describe an activity or movement.
There is exactly one in a scene (it may also be implicit).
Processes include their auxiliary verbs and copulas (e.g., ``is'' in example #1), if present.
</p>
<p>
<ul><li>
"John wants [to kick]<sub>P</sub> the ball"
</li><li>
"John finished kicking<sub>P</sub> the ball an hour ago"
</li><li>
"John seems to [have kicked]<sub>P</sub> the ball"
</li><li>
"I<sub>A</sub> expected<sub>P</sub> [John<sub>A</sub> [to come]<sub>P</sub>]<sub>A</sub>"
</li></ul>
</p>
</div>

<--ELABORATOR

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Elaborator (E)</h3>
<p>
Elaborators (E) describe a property or add some information about one specific entity or relation without
evoking a scene. The elaborated entity is the Center (C).
</p>
<ul><li>
"Big<sub>E</sub> brown<sub>E</sub> dogs<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"chocolate<sub>E</sub> cookies<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"[Millions of]<sub>E</sub> homes<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"[Heavy<sub>E</sub> water<sub>C</sub> ]<sub>E</sub> production<sub>C</sub>"
</li></p>
</div>

<--ADVERBIAL

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Advebial (D)</h3>

<p>
12. Adverbials (D) are relations that do not introduce another Scene, but semantically modify the Scene or its Process or State1. Common cases of modifications are modal relations (like "can", "may" or "want"), manner relations (like "quickly" or "patiently") and relations that specify a sub-event (like "begin" or "finish").
</p>
<p>
A scene is what we conceive at a given time, a conception of a state, action or movement. 
It has a time and location in which it happened (it need not be specified by the text though).
</p><p>
<ul><li>
"His workers treat him [with disrespect]<sub>D</sub>"
</li><li>
"John cleverly<sub>D</sub> answered the manager’s question"
</li><li>
"John<sub>A</sub> began<sub>D</sub> swimming<sub>P</sub>”
</li><li>
“John<sub>A</sub> may<sub>D</sub> come<sub>P</sub> [to the party]<sub>A</sub>”
</li>
</p></div>

<--TIME

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><b>Time (T)</b><br>
<p>
A unit whose primary purpose is to specify the time in which the Scene it is situated in occurred. However, if time is described by introducing another Participant or another Scene, it should receive a Scene or Participant category instead.
</p><p>
<ul><li>
"John<sub>A</sub> may<sub>D</sub> come<sub>P</sub> later<sub>T</sub>"
</li><li>
"John<sub>A</sub> may<sub>D</sub> come<sub>P</sub> [at around eight]<sub>T</sub>"
</li>
</p>
</div>

<--LINKER

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><b>Linker (L)</b><br>
<p>
A relation between scenes. All relations between scenes should be marked as L, except
scenes acting as participants in another scene (in which case, they're As) or scenes acting as elaborators
in another scene (in which case, they're Es).
<p></p>
In all cases, the related units of an <b>L</b> should be marked using the "Linkage" mode (accessible by the "Link" button or by pressing alt+l).
</p><p>
<ul><li>
"[John got home]<sub>H</sub> and<sub>L</sub> [took a shower]<sub>H</sub>"
</li><li>
"[I'm going home]<sub>H</sub> [in order to]<sub>L</sub> [take a shower]<sub>H</sub>"
</li><li>
"When<sub>L</sub> [I go home]<sub>H</sub> [I'll take a shower]<sub>H</sub>"
</li><li>
"[He retired]<sub>H</sub> with<sub>L</sub> [a rank of major]<sub>H</sub>" (two scenes: in one he retired, in the other he was a major)
</li>
</ul></p>
</div>

<--PARALLEL

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Parallel Scene (H)</h3>
<p>
A default category for a scene. Any scene which is not a participant in another scene or an elaborator of another entity is considered an H. 
The relation between the linked scenes should be marked as Linker (L).
</p><p>
A scene is what we conceive at a given time, a conception of a state, action or movement. 
It has a time and location in which it happened (it need not be specified by the text though).
</p>
<ul><li>
"[John got home]<sub>H</sub> and<sub>L</sub> [took a shower]<sub>H</sub>"
</li>
<li>
"[I'm going home]<sub>H</sub> [in order to]<sub>L</sub> [take a shower]<sub>H</sub>"
</li><li>
"When<sub>L</sub> [I go home]<sub>H</sub> [I'll take a shower]<sub>H</sub>"
</li><li>
"[He retired]<sub>H</sub> with<sub>L</sub> [a rank of major]<sub>H</sub>" (two scenes: in one he retired, in the other he was a major)
</li>
</ul></p>
</div>

<--GROUND

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Ground (G)</h3>
<p>
A unit is marked as a Ground Relation (G) (or Ground for short), if its primary purpose is to relate some unit to its ground (i.e., the speech event; either the speaker, the hearer or the general context in which the text was uttered/written/conceived). Gs are used for annotating mentions of the ground scene that are missing almost all their elements save for one word or expression.
</p>
<ul><li>
"[Surprisingly<sub>G</sub>, [our flight]<sub>A</sub> arrived<sub>P</sub> [on time]<sub>D</sub>]<sub>H</sub>"
</li><li>
"[[it is true]<sub>G</sub> that<sub>F</sub> John<sub>A</sub> [is rich]<sub>S</sub>]<sub>H</sub>"
</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
Note that if the ground is referred to using a complete scene (with internal structure), we analyze it as a scene, and not as a G:
</p><p><ul><li>
"I<sub>A</sub> told<sub>P</sub> you<sub>A</sub> already<sub>D</sub> [John can't make it]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
"[I<sub>A</sub> [was surprised]<sub>S</sub> ]<sub>H</sub> when<sub>L</sub> [[our flight]<sub>A</sub> arrived<sub>P</sub> [on time]<sub>D</sub>]<sub>H</sub>"
</li>
</div>

<--RELATOR

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Relator (R)</h3>
<p>
Relators (R) are relations that relate one or more entities without evoking a new scene. 
Rs in English are usually prepositions (see Appendix A in UiN for a more elaborate discussion). They have two varieties:
<ul><li>
Rs can pertain to a specific entity (much like Elaborators), but unlike Es they then relate that entity to other relations/entities in the context.
<ul><li>
"There are cookies [in<sub>R</sub> the<sub>E</sub> jar<sub>C</sub>]<sub>A</sub>"
</li><li>
"They arrived [after<sub>R</sub> dinner<sub>C</sub>]<sub>D</sub>"
</li></ul></li>
<li>
Rs can relate two or more entities that appear in the text (much like Ns). Unlike Ns, they relate entities in a way that does not highlight the similarity or symmetry between them. By convention, we place the R inside the E and not inside the C.
<ul><li>
"[a<sub>E</sub> group<sub>C</sub> of<sub>R</sub>]<sub>E</sub> journalists<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"[bottom<sub>C</sub> of<sub>R</sub>]<sub>E</sub> [the<sub>E</sub> sea<sub>C</sub>]<sub>C</sub>"
</li></ul></li>
</ul>

</div>

<--CENTER

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Center (C)</h3>
<p>
An argument of a relation that does not evoke a scene. The relation may be an R, E or N.
If two units correspond to the same entity and it is hard to say which elaborates which, both are Centers.
</p>
<p><ul><li>
"Big<sub>E</sub> brown<sub>E</sub> dogs<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"army<sub>C</sub> of<sub>R</sub> zombies<sub>C</sub>" (example of two Cs)
</li><li>
"[Millions<sub>C</sub> of<sub>R</sub>]<sub>E</sub> homes<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"[Heavy<sub>E</sub> water<sub>C</sub> ]<sub>E</sub> production<sub>C</sub>"
</li><li>
"[John<sub>C</sub> and<sub>N</sub> Mary<sub>C</sub>]<sub>A</sub> [got married]<sub>P</sub>"
</li><li>
"I<sub>A</sub> ['ll have]<sub>P</sub> [gin<sub>C</sub> and<sub>N</sub> tonic<sub>C</sub>]<sub>A</sub>"
</li></ul></p>
</div>

<--CONNECTOR

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'><h3>Connector (N)</h3>
<p>
Connectors (N) relate two or more entities (annotated as Cs) in a way that highlights the fact that they have a similar feature or type. They are usually conjuncts such as "and", "or", "instead of" or "except".
</p>
<p><ul><li>
"[John<sub>C</sub> and<sub>N</sub> Mary<sub>C</sub>]<sub>A</sub> [got married]<sub>P</sub>"
</li><li>
"I<sub>A</sub> ['ll have]<sub>P</sub> [gin<sub>C</sub> and<sub>N</sub> tonic<sub>C</sub>]<sub>A</sub>"
</li></ul></p>
</div>

<--REFERENCE

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Reference:</h3> 
<p>
We use this option to mark the referent of a pronoun or a deicitive expression (such as "these people").
In order to mark a referrent:
<ul>
<li> put the focus on the unit you wish to add a referent to (pronoun or deictic expression).</li>
<li> you choose the "reference" button on the right-hand side. </li>
<li> the cursor then changes and the color of the unit in question changes as well. </li>
<li> you may now select any unit which is not an ancestor or a descendent as a referent. you may also open the LRU scroll menu to choose a unit from there. </li>
<li> once a unit was selected, you will see an indication of it in the box of the unit to which a referent was added (the pronoun/deictic). </li>
<li> in order to change your selection, you may repeat the process, the new selection will override the former. </li>
<li> if you wish to delete the referent entirely, you may press the "del" button while in referent selection mode (that is, after pressing the button) or alternatively,
press the arrow which indicates the referent. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<--REMOTE
<p>
An inferred participant or relation, not directly referred to in the scene it participates in.
A remote unit is the case where the unit is directly referred to in another point in the text. When it isn't, it's an implicit unit.
</p>
<p>
To mark an omitted unit, we put the unit which we want to add the omitted unit to in focus and press one of the add remote unit buttons (marked as an R on the category buttons).
This enters omission mode (the cursor also changes to a cross). We can now select any unit non-descendent, non-ancestor unit as a remote unit of the unit in focus.
You can also choose a unit from the scroll-down menu (press the ruler on the upper-right side of the screen to see it).
</p>
</div>

<--IMPLICIT

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Implicit Units:</h3>
<p>
An inferred participant, not directly referred to in any place in the text.
It appears neither in the scene it participates in, nor in any other place in the text.
This button can be used to add an implicit unit, but only in omitted unit selection mode (after one of the "add remote unit" buttons have been pressed).
</p>
</div>

<--LINK

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Set Link:</h3> Used to select the units related by a linker.
<p>
Linkers appear either in the case of scene linkage or in the case of a secondary binary 
relation in a scene (usually coordination).
</p>
<p>
In order to establish a link, you must select a linker and his arguments. A linker may have one or more arguments.
Once the units are selected, press the "Link" button. A chain icon will appear next to the linker. If you hover
on top of it, you may see the arguments linked by that linker highlighted in faint blue. There is also a tooltip
indicating what these units are.
Each linker may only be assigned to one linkage. If you repeat this procedure for the same linker, the newly selected
units override the previous ones. If you change the category of this unit to be anything other than linker, the link
will be removed as well.
</p>
</div>

<--GROUP

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>(Un)group:</h3>
<p>
When several unit are selected, this button forms a new unit of the default category, having the selected units as its children.
When a single unit is selected, it dismantles it (but not its sub-units, which are shoved one level above).
</p>
</div>

<--FINISH

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Finish All:</h3>
<p>
Declares all units as finished. If successful, all units should be now hidden and the annotation saved. If you wish to reedit a unit,
double click on it, and its window will re-open.
</p>
</div>

<--COMBINE

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Combine:</h3>
<p>
If you believe two consecutive tokens should have in fact constituted a single token, select them and press 'combine'.
This will combine them into a single token.</p>
<p>A common case where this can happen is with periods that are used for acronyms and
were erroneously separated from the acronym (e.g., "U.S.A .").
</p>
<p>This button can also be used to separate a token containing non-alphanumeric characters to separate tokens delimited by the non-alphanumerics. This is useful if you believe the word has internal structure. If you wish to do so, select such a token, and press the "combine" button.</p>
</div>

<--UNCERTAIN

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Uncertain:</h3>
<p>
If you are uncertain as to how to annotate some unit, annotate it the best you can, but mark it with an "uncertain" tag using this button.
Please also write in the comments, what made this unit difficult to annotate (e.g., whether it is the inadequacy of the annotation scheme,
unclear instructions, ambiguity which you found hard to resolve etc.).
</p>
</div>

<--UNANALYZABLE

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px; padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px;'>
<h3>Unanalyzable:</h3>
<p>
If you believe a multi-word unit has no meaningful sub-units, you should mark this unit as unanalyzable by pressing this button.
If you want to remote this annotation, press the button again.
</p>
</div>


<--HOME_ADMIN

<div style='position: relative; left: 10px;'>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>
The passages are the basic units of annotation. 
The may consist of a sentence, a paragraph or a few paragraphs.
A task is an assignment of a passage to a user.

<ul>
<li>
<b>Manage Projects</b> - allows you to see all existing projects and their details.
                         it also allows you to create a new project. A project is associated
                         with some configuration file that defines the scheme and a version number.
                         the version number must match the config file.
                         a task is always associated with some specific project.
</li>
<li>
<b>Manage Users</b> - allows you to see all registered users and their details. 
                      It allows you to set some users as administrators or to set them as inactive.
